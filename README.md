### 1) Difference of Means

 * Uses bayesian PyMC model to estimate the mean of a long-tailed distribution to calculate the true difference.  

### 2) Propensity Scores

 * Uses propensity score models to see how we can remove the effect of external confounders from our estimates.

### 3) Meta Learners

 * Does the same as the above but uses ML models to get _conditional_ average treatment effects.
